			<h1>{`Welcome to the Augur beta test!`}</h1>
			<p>{`This is a beta test in advance of Augur's live release. There are bugs. There are features being
				added, improved, and re-designed. There are a few hundred enhancements scheduled to be added in the next few
				months. Your thoughtful feedback now is essential. Please use the feedback button at the bottom left of
				every page to submit your feedback, or feel free to send an email to `}

			<h2>Important information:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Because Augur is a <b>completely decentralized</b> system, if you lose your login credentials it
					is impossible to recover them. Please <a className="link" href="http://blog.augur.net/faq/how-do-i-savebackup-my-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take
					appropriate measures</a> to protect the safety of your password, and create a way to
					recover your credentials if you forget them.
				</li>
				<li>
					Do not send real Ether (ETH) to your Augur account while we are testing! Each account will be given
					10,000 testnet ETH tokens for beta testing. Please note that testnet ETH has no value except for testing:
					it is merely an on-contract IOU (a token) for testnet Ether.
				</li>
				<li>
					{`Reputation (REP) is a unique and important part of the Augur trading platform. If you own REP tokens, you must visit
					the site periodically to fulfill your reporting obligations. During beta testing, each new account will
					receive 47 testnet REP (they have no value except for testing). Each reporting cycle will last 2 days. Every
					two-day cycle will consist of a commit phase, a reveal phase, and a challenge phase. Because the test
					cycle is dramatically compressed (the main net cycle will be 60 days long) it is recommended that
					users visit the site at least every 2 days to maintain your REP and simulate “real money” trading,
					resolution, and reporting conditions. Learn `}

					{`A note on price/time priority on the blockchain.  The site is only as fast as Ethereum blocks are mined.  Augur's matching engine sorts order books by price, then by block number, then by transaction index. Within a single block, transactions are ordered by the miner who mines the block.  When constructing a block, miners typically order transactions first by gasprice (highest to lowest), and then by the order received (oldest to newest).  So, Augur's "price/blocknumber/transaction index priority" ordering is generally equivalent to price/time priority, if there are differing gasprices within the block, the transaction index is not guaranteed to be time-ordered.  (Presently, Augur does not attempt to adjust gasprices in response to other pending transactions, although, if desired, gasprice can be adjusted manually using the API, by changing the "gasPrice" field attached to every sendTransaction payload.)`}

			<h2>Technical updates:</h2>
			<h3>Decembter 22, 2016</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Converted maker trade transactions now have distinct messaging from normal (taker) trade transactions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Removed unnecessary registration filter.
				</li>
				<li>
					Refactored load-account-trades into composable loaders: deposit-withdraw, bids-asks, create-market, account-trades, and reporting.
				</li>
				<li>
					Placing a trade not longer automatically navigates you to the transactions view, but rather will leave you on the market view.
				</li>
				<li>
					Added final deleteTransaction call to trade process actions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Fees for maker trades no longer incorrectly display the taker fee.
