# Monorepo

## What tools do I need to use?

All Augur monorepo tasks should be accomplished using `yarn` except some publishing tasks which also rely on `lerna`.

## Have you had a chance to answer the previous question?

Yes, after a few months we finally found the answer. Sadly, Mike is on vacations right now so I'm afraid we are not able to provide the answer at this point.
