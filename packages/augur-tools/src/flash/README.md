# Flash Scripts

## Running a local node with canned markets

First, enter interactive mode: `yarn flash interactive`
In interactive mode (It will show `augur$` in the terminl):

    ganache
    deploy
    create-canned-markets

The local ganache node is now running in your terminal. You can interact with it using flash commands.
Type `help` for a list.

## FAQ

Pro Tip: Interactive mode has tab-completion so instead of

    create-canned-markets

you can type

    cr <TAB> c

# Flash Session on local node

 * yarn docker:geth:pop

To use flash for a session to push time report or dispute. use interactive mode

## Connect
This connects the session to ethereum node, connect as a specific user and/or start SDK in order to use getters

for options `connect --help`
`-u` to connect the SDK
`-a` to specify an account address to use, if not contract owner account is used.
`-n` for network, don't specify this for local node on port 8545

Some scripts need SDK getters to get MarketInfo for example. The script that need SDK will print a message if the SDK isn't wired up.


## push-timestamp

for options `push-timestamp --help`

## initial-report

Will initial report for a market, it's possible to add pre-emptive stake, check `--help` for details.

## dispute

Will dispute a market that has a tentive winning outcome


# Templates

## generate templates

If templates or picklists need to change, update `templates-template.ts` in augur-tools then run
`yarn flash-util generate-templates`. The templates.ts file will get updated in augur-artifacts.

## show-template

Given a template hash this script will display the template. hash values are found in `templates.ts` file in augur-artifacts. Note that this is a generated file using the flash command `generate-templates`

ie `yarn flash-util show-template --hash 0xb1e8150accfc1fb7e312342f9a45f333e7468dbdb39ca696501d221fc72a1675`

## validate-template

Script to help market creators to verify their market will be validated as a templated market. This can be very helpful when creating markets through APIs or directly on contract. Template structure will be described in v2 docs.

`yarn flash-util validate-template --title 'Will the CAC 40 close on or above 5200 on December 6, 2019?' --templateInfo '{"hash":"0x7c631efb5047c650e6afab2b7793caef8d28c6eb0adcf2710497a05f4acbad8d","question":"Will the [0] close on or above [1] on [2]?","inputs":[{"id":0,"value":"CAC 40","type":"DROPDOWN","timestamp":"CAC 40"},{"id":1,"value":"5200","type":"TEXT","timestamp":"5200"},{"id":2,"value":"December 6, 2019","type":"DATEYEAR","timestamp":"December 6, 2019"}]}' --endTime 1575763200 --resolutionRules 'Closing date is determine by the location of the exchange, where the underlying stocks for the index are traded'`


--title: is the title of the market that will populate description in market creation transaction.
--templateInfo: is the JSON.stringify version of template object in extraInfo in market creation transaction.
--endTime: is the timestamp for event expiration of the market, endTime in market creation transaction.
--resolutionRules: resolution rules separated by '\n' that would be included in extraInfo in market creation transaction.

The script will return 'success' for successful, meaning validation verified the market would be considered a templated market

If there is a failed validation step, `error: ...` and give an error of why.
Errors:

1. Required parameter missing:
error: `value missing template | hash | question | inputs | endTime`

2. Template has been retired and auto-failed, values in `packages/augur-tools/src/templates-retired.ts` and put in `templates.ts` in augur-artifacts:
error: `template hash has been retired and set to auto-fail`

3. If hash given doesn't have a validation structure in templates.ts
error: `no validation found for hash`

4. If the given market title doesn't match the constructed market title based on template inputs, example.
"Will the [0] close on or above [1] on [2]?" template string has input indexes the template.inputs fill in the indexes to produce a calculated market title "Will the CAC 40 close on or above 5200 on December 6, 2019?" given that the values are 0: 'CAC 40' 1: '5200' 2: 'December 6, 2019'
error: `populated title does not match title given`

5. For a few templates inputs have to fall within a numeric range. If template inputs are outside of the numeric range this error will occur
error: `numeric input is outside of valid numeric range`

6. For some templates they use ESTDATETIME input type, which is a timestamp for the estimated time the event is scheduled to start. that timestamp can not be before the market's expiration time (endTime)
error: `estimated schedule date time is after market event expiration endTime`

7. For some markets there is are a number of required days between date in market question and market's event expiration.
error: `start date in question is not the required number of days before market event expiration endTime`

8. Templates with years in the question need to be validated so that the year is not before market creation or after market event expiration.
error: `year in market question can not be before market creationTime year or after event expiration year`

9. For some templates the DATEYEAR input type can not be on a weekend.
error: `market question date can not be on weekend or on a holiday`

10. There are templates that give date range in the market question. These templates can not have the end date before the start date.
error: `market question end date can not be after start date`

11. For templates that rely on identifying a stock or index traded on exchange the market event expiration needs to be 1 hour after the latest possible time the exchange closes. Example part of the year NASDAQ closes at UTC -4 and other part UTC -5, with a one hour buffer and assuming the lastest closing time UTC -4 the market event expiration needs to be at UTC -3.
error: `event expiration can not be before exchange close time, or market creation after exchange close time`

12. For movie total gross for opening weekend, the market event expiration needs to have a buffer. The earilest market event expiration time is the Wednesday after opening weekend.
error: `event expiration can not be before Wednesday after movie opening weekend and/or opening day must be a friday`

13. For some templates they use DATESTART or DATEYEAR or DATETIME or ESTDATETIME input type, which is a timestamp for the day the event is scheduled to start. that timestamp can not be before the market's expiration time (endTime) and market creation time can not be before the date of event
error: `date in market question can not be before market creationTime or after event expiration`

14. Template inputs can not have duplicate values
error: `template input values have duplicates`

15. Outcome values can not have duplicate values
error: `outcome array has duplicates`

16. Validations have a regex for Market questions (title) based on input values needed to populated the market question template. Example, `Will the CAC 40 close on or above 5200 on December 6, 2019?` has to meet the following regex.

```
^Will the (S&P 500 Index|Dow Jones Industrial Average|Nasdaq Composite|Wilshire 5000|Russell 1000|NYSE Composite|MSCI World Index|FTSE All-World Index|Dow Jones Global Titans 50|S&P Global 100 Index|FTSE 100|DAX|Shanghai SE Composite|Hang Seng|Nikkei 225|S&P/TSX Composite|CAC 40|All Ordinaries|BSE Sensex 30|KOSPI Index|VIX) close on or above [0-9]+.*[0-9]* on (January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|September|October|November|December) ([0-9]){2}, 20|([0-9]{2})\\?$
```
Notice that dropdown values are included and specific date format has to be met.
error: `populated market question does not match regex`

17. Most categorical templates have required outcomes, for example, "Other (Field)" is required so that a market can resolve with a valid outcome of the winning outcome isn't listed explicitly.
error: `required outcomes are missing`

18. Some categorical templates do not allow additional user outcomes, for example, there are a few Golf templates that all required outcomes are the only allowed outcomes to be on the templated market.
error: `no additioanl outcomes is a requirement, only required outcomes are allowed`

19. Special data dropdown dependencies have to be met, for example, a crypto BTC/USD market can not use BTC/EUR source for market resolution.
error: `market question dropdown dependencies values are incorrect`

20. There is also possible Special data dropdown dependencies for outcomes, if an American Football market is for AFC football championship. NFC teams can not be used as outcomes.
error: `outcome dependencies are incorrect`

21. There are categorical markets that use market question inputs in outcomes. These values need to match, example Point Spread markets have the team name and points in the outcome. `[Team A] -[Whole #].5` gets updated with the team choice and points from market question to produce the outcome. example `Arizona Cardinals -4.5`
error: `outcomes values from substituted market question inputs are incorrect`

22. The resolution rules hash of passed in resolution rules needs to match the hash of the resolution rules in the validation structure.
error: `hash of resolution details is different than validation resolution rules hash`

23. For unexpected result like a crash error will be formated like `unknown, ...` with catch exception.

24. Templated markets need to be in the correct categories. ie. if template is located in Sports, Hockey then the created market needs to be in Sports, Hockey.
error: `templated market does not have correct categories`
