# TODO: Figure out if the returns are correct when selling LP tokens minted _after_ fees were generated.
#       Right now it looks incorrect but it's possible (likely even) that the combined value of returned shares+cash are equal to the value put in when adding liquidity.
#       I tried adding cash to the average of the shares. It ended up with ~10.07 avg shares and ~1003 cash.
#           Need to calculate the actual value of the shares, not just their average quantities.

# TODO tests
# 1. Two users add and remove liquidity, without trading occuring.
# 2. Two users add liquidity, then other users trade, then the users remove liquidity.
#    The worry is that our reward function doesn't work quite right so users won't get back what they put in.
# 3. User adds liqudity. Then there's trading. Then another user adds liquidity. They should get the right number of LP tokens.
#    And when the users remove liquidity, they get the number of shares and cash that makes sense.
# 4. Users swap and enter and exit positions.
# 5. The sqrt functions for safemath int and uint work as expected. Alex wrote them but there just aren't any tests yet.
# 6. Verify specific enterPosition costs.
