/**
 * @dev Implementation of the `IERC777` interface.
 *
 * This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
 * that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using `_mint`.
 *
 * Support for ERC20 is included in this contract, as specified by the EIP: both
 * the ERC777 and ERC20 interfaces can be safely used when interacting with it.
 * Both `IERC777.Sent` and `IERC20.Transfer` events are emitted on token
 * movements.
 *
 * Additionally, the `granularity` value is hard-coded to `1`, meaning that there
 * are no special restrictions in the amount of tokens that created, moved, or
 * destroyed. This makes integration with ERC20 applications seamless.
 *
 * AUGUR Modifications:
 *  - Public burning functions are note available. The ERC777 standard says they can be made to fail for some or all calls.
 *  - A hook is exposed for subclasses to send additional logs on transfer events
 *  - The ERC1820 Registry contract is not hardcoded but instead provided later on in the class heirarchy during runtime. This makes testing simpler.
 *  - To follow coding standards some member variables with underscores were renamed in favor of simply exposing those variables to satisfy ERC20 and ERC777 interface requirements
 *  - The internal _mint function allows a boolean to specify requireReceptionAck. Our variable supply tokens will not require this.
 *  - The internal _burn function allows a boolean to specify wether 1820 hooks are called. Our variable supply tokens will not call them. Calling them would put our contracts at risk for malicious hooks
 *
