# Contributing to the Augur Project
Thank you for taking the time to contribute to the Augur Project! Before you start, please read the following guidelines and our [code of conduct.](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

### Versions
Make sure to be using Python 2.7.xx, and Ethereum 1.6.1. It is recommended to clone from the master branch for both [Pyethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum). Pyethereum may install Ethereum 1.4.0 -- uninstall the latter if it happens. Check your version of Ethereum by running this on terminal: `pip show ethereum | grep Version`
Check your version of python by running this: `python --version`

### Pull Requests and Issues
[Pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) are welcome.  Make sure to run the tests (via docker is easiest) and verify the linter (Solium) doesn't complain. When [raising issues](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/), follow the appropriate issue template in the root directory. Make sure commit messages are informative and concise.

### Communication
Finally, join the Augur Project on Slack! Invite yourself [here](http://invite.augur.net/).
