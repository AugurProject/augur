## Development

This project uses [npm](http://npmjs.com/) and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).

### Run

Get the source code and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-web.git
cd orbit-web/
npm install
```

Start the application:
`npm run dev`

_Run will start a development server, open the app in the browser and watch for changes in the source files. Upon change, it'll automatically compile and reload the app in the browser_

### Build

`npm run build`

_This produces a fully stand-alone build in `dist/` which can be run from `dist/index.html` file or on a http-server._
