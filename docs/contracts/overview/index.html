This account has the authority to indicate the singleton contracts for Augur as they are deployed by “registering” them with an identifying string. For example when the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#contract-responsible-for-providing-a-price-for-the-rep-token">contract responsible for providing a price for the REP token</a> is uploaded it is registered with the string “RepOracle”. Other contracts that depend on the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#rep-oracle">Rep Oracle</a> contract will look up its address through the Augur contract when they are first initialized.</p><p>At the end of the deployment process the Augur contract has a function called “finishDeployment” which will revoke authorization to register any new contracts and will emit an event to indicate this has occurred.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="contract-legitimacy"></a>Contract Legitimacy<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#contract-legitimacy" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>In addition to storing a registry of the singleton contracts uploaded during deployment the Augur contract contains a variety of mappings which are used to store which generated contracts are legitimate products of the Augur deployment.</p><p>When contract instances are generated, such as:</p><ul><li><a href="/docs/contracts/overview#markets">Markets</a></li><li><a href="/docs/contracts/overview#universes">Universes</a></li><li><a href="/docs/contracts/overview#bonds">Bonds</a></li></ul><p>They are stored in the Augur mapping so that various contract interactions can validate the legitimacy of a sender claiming for example to be a Market instance.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="contract-events"></a>Contract Events<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#contract-events" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Augur’s contract events are emitted from the Augur contract in the vast majority of cases.

This structure means a client can use a single contract address filter while listening to events, or bulk downloading logs, and receive events for all the varied events generated by the contracts.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="authorized-token-transfers"></a>Authorized Token Transfers<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#authorized-token-transfers" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Many Augur contracts need to be able to transfer DAI on behalf of the tx sender. Rather than requiring the account to authorize each of these individual contracts the Augur contract maintains a list of “trusted” contract addresses which may request a transferFrom on their behalf. This reduces the various approvals to users simply approving the Augur contract.</p><p>It should be noted that this only applies to the core Augur contracts. The <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#trading">Trading</a> contracts which are discussed later require a variety of additional approvals by users, though this can be largely ignored if the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#augur-wallet">Augur wallet</a> is being used.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="upgrade-day"></a>Upgrade Day<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#upgrade-day" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>When it is desired by a group of developers to deploy a new version of the Augur protocol they must announce their intention to do so with advance notice such that those who intend to switch to it may exit all their funds from the existing version. Because of this the Augur contract has a notion of an “Upgrade day” which occurs on a regular cadence, currently one year from the deploy date, where that date serves as a cutoff for the maximum market end date. Markets created within a month of the upgrade day may specify an end date of a month in the future even if that extends past the upgrade day.</p><p>The first upgrade day is a chosen constant and is currently set to be July 15th 2021.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="universes"></a>Universes<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#universes" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>A Universe in Augur is a collection of markets and is itself a <strong>node</strong> in a <strong>tree</strong> of <strong>interpretations of truth</strong>. During deployment the initial Universe, called the “Genesis Universe”, is created. The “Genesis Universe” is a blank slate and carries no implicit qualities. It simply contains markets. The Genesis Universe however may end up with Child Universes which are each representative of an interpretation of the truth. For example Child A of the Genesis universe may be the sub-version of the Augur deployment where all participants believe that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 United States presidential election, and Universe B is the version where Donald Trump won. More on this process of Universe creation is detailed in the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#forking">forking</a> section.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="markets"></a>Markets<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#markets" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Every Market in Augur is part of a Universe. Aside from the implicit assertions about the nature of reality and truth that are inherited from a Universe there are various on-chain properties that a Market derives from its Universe.

This fee is how active REP holders are compensated for maintaining vigilance of the platform and what gives the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#reputation-token">Reputation Token</a> inherent value.</p><p>The value of the reporting fee is determined by using the current <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#open-interest">Open Interest</a> of the platform and the current value of the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#reputation-token">Reputation Token</a> both denominated in DAI. The desire is for income generated for REP holders to give enough value to the REP token such that the REP Market Cap is 5x the value of all funds locked in the platform. In this way until the Market Cap in REP is high enough to provide the desired ratio the reporting fee will continue increasing.</p><p>The calculation of a new reporting fee for a Universe is done with the following algorithm (<a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur/blob/master/packages/augur-core/source/contracts/reporting/Universe.sol#L584" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see code</a>):</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_1XEh"><div class="codeBlockContent_1u-d"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_10dd">Copy</button><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-javascript codeBlock_3iAC"><div class="codeBlockLines_b7E3" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">repTokenMarketCap </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">=</span><span class="token plain"> repTokenPrice </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">*</span><span class="token plain"> totalThereticalRepTokenSupply</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">repTokenTargetMarketCap </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">=</span><span class="token plain"> openInterest </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">*</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:rgb(247, 140, 108)">5</span><span class="token plain"></span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">newFeeDivisor </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">=</span><span class="token plain"> previousFee </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">*</span><span class="token plain"> repTokenMarketCap </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">/</span><span class="token plain"> repTokenTargetMarketCap</span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">newFeeDivisor </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token known-class-name class-name" style="color:rgb(255, 203, 107)">Math</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">.</span><span class="token method function property-access" style="color:rgb(130, 170, 255)">max</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token number" style="color:rgb(247, 140, 108)">3</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">,</span><span class="token plain"> newFeeDivisor</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token plain">      </span><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(105, 112, 152);font-style:italic">// Maximum 33.3% Fee</span><span class="token plain"></span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">newFeeDivisor </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token known-class-name class-name" style="color:rgb(255, 203, 107)">Math</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">.</span><span class="token method function property-access" style="color:rgb(130, 170, 255)">min</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token number" style="color:rgb(247, 140, 108)">10000</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">,</span><span class="token plain"> newFeeDivisor</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token plain">  </span><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(105, 112, 152);font-style:italic">// Minimum 0.01% Fee</span></div></div></div></div></div><p>The initial reporting fee for any new Universe is 0.01% and the fee is recalculated on demand on a weekly cadence.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="reputation-token"></a>Reputation Token<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#reputation-token" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The Reputation Token, commonly referred to as REP, of a Universe is an ERC20 token which is used to stake on and therefore determine <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#market">Market</a> payout <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#resolutions">resolutions</a>.</p><p>The genesis Universe&#x27;s supply is generated by migrating <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#legacy-reputation-tokens">Legacy Reputation Tokens</a>.

Parasitic OI is bad for Augur as it creates an unknowable amount of funds which if sufficiently high could create an incentive to resolve a market to an incorrect outcome.

The floating value algorithm is as follows (<a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur/blob/13c2079b03158583b17210c88b775156b9690a47/packages/augur-core/source/contracts/utility/Formulas.sol#L41" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see code</a>):</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_1XEh"><div class="codeBlockContent_1u-d"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_10dd">Copy</button><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-javascript codeBlock_3iAC"><div class="codeBlockLines_b7E3" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token keyword" style="font-style:italic">if</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token plain">currentPercent </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">&lt;=</span><span class="token plain"> targetPercent</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">{</span><span class="token plain"></span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">    scaleFactor </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">=</span><span class="token plain"> currentPercent </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">/</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token number" style="color:rgb(247, 140, 108)">10</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">*</span><span class="token plain"> targetPercent</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">+</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:rgb(247, 140, 108)">0.9</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">;</span><span class="token plain"></span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">}</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token keyword" style="font-style:italic">else</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">{</span><span class="token plain"></span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">    scaleFactor </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">=</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token plain">currentPercent </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">-</span><span class="token plain"> targetPercent</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">/</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">(</span><span class="token number" style="color:rgb(247, 140, 108)">1</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">-</span><span class="token plain"> targetPercent</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">)</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">+</span><span class="token plain"> </span><span class="token number" style="color:rgb(247, 140, 108)">1</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">;</span><span class="token plain"></span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(199, 146, 234)">}</span><span class="token plain"></span></div><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">newPercent </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">=</span><span class="token plain"> currentPercent </span><span class="token operator" style="color:rgb(137, 221, 255)">*</span><span class="token plain"> scaleFactor</span></div></div></div></div></div><p>This algorithm results in the value fluctuating between <strong>.9</strong> * the previous value and <strong>2x</strong> the previous value. The reason Augur drops the value slower than it increases is that once a suitable value has been found it is in the system’s best interest for it to remain at that level. If at any point for example there were enough no shows to double the value it should not immediately drop to its previous level if all designated reports occur.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="left"><strong>Bond</strong></th><th align="left"><strong>Value Checked</strong></th><th align="left"><strong>Target Percentage</strong></th><th align="left"><strong>Initial Value</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><a href="/docs/contracts/overview#no-show">No Show</a></td><td align="left">The REP value of <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#designated-reports">designated reports</a> VS No Shows</td><td align="left">5%</td><td align="left">0.35 REP</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><a href="/docs/contracts/overview#initial-report">Initial Report</a></td><td align="left">The REP value of incorrect <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#initial-reports">initial reports</a></td><td align="left">1%</td><td align="left">0.35 REP</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><a href="/docs/contracts/overview#validity">Validity</a></td><td align="left">The DAI value of validity bonds VS number of Invalid Markets</td><td align="left">1%</td><td align="left">$10</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Each bond is discussed more in the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#markets">Markets</a> and <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#reporting">Reporting</a> sections.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="markets-1"></a>Markets<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#markets-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Markets are the contract instances encapsulating events which can be predicted in Augur. Nearly everything of interest that occurs in Augur has a Market as the context. This section will largely concern itself with the creation of Markets and the meaning of their various properties since other sections cover more specific means of interaction with them.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="creation-parameters"></a>Creation Parameters<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#creation-parameters" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Outcomes (</strong><a href="/docs/contracts/overview#categorical"><strong>Categorical</strong></a> <strong>Only):</strong> In a categorical market the name of each outcome must be provided. For example if the market was on the winner of an election each candidate would have their own outcome. For ALL markets the first outcome is always <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#invalid">Invalid</a> and is added automatically. For <a href="/docs/contracts/overview">Yes/No</a> and <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#scalar">Scalar</a> markets the outcomes are fixed as Invalid / No / Yes and Invalid / Long / Short respectively.</li><li><strong>Description:</strong> The description of a market is the long version of the human readable instructions on how to resolve the market.</li><li><strong>Title:</strong> The title is a short description of the question the market is asking, e.g “Who will win the 2020 United States Presidential Election”</li><li><strong>Min / Max Prices (</strong><a href="/docs/contracts/overview#scalar"><strong>Scalar</strong></a> <strong>Only):</strong> The Min &amp; Max Prices indicate the off chain desired range of prices. In Yes/No and Categorical markets these values are always 0 and 10**18 respectively, resulting in an off-chain range of 0 and 1. For scalar markets one may desire a custom range such as when tracking the price of a stock. If that stock value is currently $1700 it would make sense to have a min value of 0 and a max value of 3400 * 10**18, resulting in a market that is tracking the movement of the share price from complete collapse to doubling.</li><li><strong>Num Ticks (</strong><a href="/docs/contracts/overview#scalar"><strong>Scalar</strong></a> <strong>Only):</strong> The “Num Ticks” of a market is the precision of prices and the value of a <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#complete-set-of-shares">complete set of shares</a>. In Yes/No and Categorical markets this value is always 100. This results in prices which are denominated in pennies. For scalar markets more novel pricing intervals may be desired such as a market tracking the price of a stock. If that stock value is currently $1700 it could make sense for example to use a Num Ticks value of 3400 which would denominate prices in a dollar if the min/max price range was 0 to 3400 * 10**18. If instead a numTicks of 340 was used prices would be in increments of $10.</li><li><strong>Market Creator Fee:</strong> The Market creator fee is a fee extracted during share settlement that is held until a market resolves as <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#valid">valid</a> and is then given to the market owner. It can be anywhere in the range of 0% to 15% of the value of sold <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#shares">shares</a>.</li><li><strong>Affiliate Validator:</strong> The Affiliate Validator is a contract reference that may be specified optionally and is used to filter which share settlements will extract an affiliate fee. More information on <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#affiliates">affiliates</a> is later in the Markets section.</li><li><strong>Affiliate Fee:</strong> The affiliate fee is a percentage of the Market Creator Fee specified as a divisor which is given to referrers of traders.

Trading on the market is never actually halted so this is sometimes referred to as the “Reporting Start Time” instead. Typically this value is expected to be some buffer of time after the event or prediction is expected to end.</li></ul><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="market-types"></a>Market Types<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#market-types" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>There are currently three “types” of markets which all operate the exact same on chain, but have different expectations for resolution and display off chain.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="yes--no"></a>Yes / No<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#yes--no" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Yes / No markets as one might imagine are events that can be resolved by answering Yes or No. As an example the market “Will event X occur by date D” would be a Yes / No market. When the market resolves shares of exactly one of Invalid, Yes, or No shares will be redeemable for 100 attoDai.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="categorical"></a>Categorical<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#categorical" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Categorical markets are markets with &gt; 2 non-Invalid outcomes. For example a market predicting the winner of an election with 3 or more candidates would be a Categorical. When the market resolves shares of exactly one of these candidate’s or Invalid shares will be redeemable for 100 attoDai.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="scalar"></a>Scalar<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#scalar" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Scalar markets are the most unusual of the 3 current market types. They are constructs intended to track a value and pay out according to a position on the value’s directional movement. The most clear example of this is a market tracking the value of a stock. Lets say a stock is currently worth $50. Now let’s say there is a scalar market tracking this stock which has a num tick value of 20, and an off chain range of 40-60. User A believes the value will rise and so places an order to buy LONG shares “at $51”. User B believes that it will go down and takes this order (the same as buying SHORT shares).</p><p>In this scenario User A pays $11 and User B pays $9. The range here is limited to the values 40-60 so when a position is taken it is relative to the range, thus a bid at $51 will end up costing 51-40.</p><p>Now let’s say at market resolution the stock value is $55. This market would pay out holders of LONG shares $15 per share (55-40 == 15) and holders of SHORT shares $5. In this way the position in a scalar market tracks a value and pays out accordingly rather than following a “winner take all” model like the other market types.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="rep-bond"></a>REP Bond<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#rep-bond" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>When a market is created a deposit of REP is required in order to fulfil 2 different bond requirements. The REP required is <strong>the maximum</strong> of both:</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="no-show-bond"></a>No Show Bond<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#no-show-bond" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The No Show Bond is a REP deposit given to the market to account for the event the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#designated-reporter">designated reporter</a> does not show up and provide an initial report for the market. It will float over time relative to the amount of No Show REP bonds in markets against the frequency of designated reporters not showing up. When an initial report occurs this bond is always used to fund that report.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="initial-report-bond"></a>Initial Report Bond<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#initial-report-bond" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The Initial Report Bond is the value required for the very first <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#payout">payout</a> reported during market resolution. It will float over time relative to the proportion of Initial REP bond payments and the number of markets which actually resolve to the initially reported payout.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="validity-bond"></a>Validity Bond<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#validity-bond" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The Validity bond is a DAI deposit given to the market to incentivize the market creator to craft a market which will not resolve as Invalid. If the market resolves as <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#valid">valid</a> it will be returned to the creator, otherwise it will be given to the next pool of fees collected for reporters.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="shares"></a>Shares<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#shares" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Shares in a market are the representation of a particular outcome.

In a <a href="/docs/contracts/overview">Yes / No</a> market a complete set would be 1 share each of Invalid, Yes, and No shares. Shares are only ever generated as complete sets. A complete set can be purchased from the Share Token contract for <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#numticks">numTicks</a> attoDAI.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="settlement"></a>Settlement<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#settlement" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Settlement is the term used to describe shares being burned in exchange for DAI. Complete Sets may always be burned in exchange for <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#numticks">numTicks</a> attoDai. Once a market has <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#finalized">finalized</a>, shares may be burned for their <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#payout">payout</a> value.</p><p>Though the settlement values are numTicks and the outcome payout, whenever settlement occurs fees are extracted from this settlement. In particular the market creator fee and the reporting fee are subtracted from the settlement value.</p><p>As an example let say a Market has a 1% creator fee and the system currently has a 0.5% reporting fee.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="resolution"></a>Resolution<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#resolution" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>When a market has reached its end time it enters <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#reporting">Reporting</a>, which is the process of finalizing a market with a <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#payout">payout</a>. There are 3 important distinctions for how a market can resolve below.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="valid"></a>Valid<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#valid" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>In normal circumstances a non-<a href="/docs/contracts/overview#scalar">Scalar</a> market will resolve with a payout where one non-Invalid outcome receives numTicks attoDai. More generally they resolve with a normal outcome as the “winner”. For example in a Yes / No market a normal resolution is for Yes or No to win.</p><p>In Scalar markets a valid outcome will be a payout that distributes numTicks attoDai between the LONG and SHORT outcomes (1 and 2 respectively).</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="invalid"></a>Invalid<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#invalid" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>A Market should resolve as “Invalid” if the outcome cannot be determined. A market with ambiguous rules or where the event ends after the end time of the market are obvious examples that should be resolved as Invalid, however there are a <a href="https://themajority.report/precedents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">host of other conditions</a> that have historically led to Markets resolving Invalid as well.</p><p>When a market is resolved as Invalid Invalid shares will pay out numTicks attoDai and all other shares are worthless.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="fork"></a>Fork<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#fork" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>One of the most critical components of the Augur platform is the ability for Markets to resolve in a fork. The concept of a fork is discussed more in the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#universes">Universe </a>section and the process by which a dispute results in a fork is described in the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#reporting">Reporting </a>section.</p><p>From the forking market’s perspective the eventual resolution will actually function just like a normal Valid or Invalid resolution. The way in which the final payout is determined is all that is materially different. Shares will still be redeemable in the same fashion and the payout for those shares follows the same rules.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="affiliates"></a>Affiliates<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#affiliates" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>When <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#settlement">settlement</a> occurs and fees are taken if the market has specified an affiliate fee and a market creator fee the system will attempt to award fees for the account that referred the trader causing the transaction.</p><p>An Augur deployment has an “Affiliates” contract which stores a referring address and a browser fingerprint for a given account. During the normal client based setup of an account these are set for them however a user interacting directly with the contracts could set these values manually if desired.</p><p>The fingerprint value is simply used as a naive check to try and filter out self referrals by comparing the fingerprint of the referrer and the account doing the transaction. If they are equal affiliate fees will not be awarded.</p><p>Assuming the market has not specified an Affiliate Validator contract and the fingerprints do not match then the referring address will be given 80% of the market specified affiliate fee and the remaining 20% is kicked back to the transaction sender. This split occurs to incentivize users to have and keep a referrer instead of attempting to avoid or take advantage of the system.</p><p>If an Affiliate Validator contract has been specified there will be an additional validation step before fees are awarded which takes the referring address and the transaction sender address and validates that they are registered in that validator contract and that they do not share an affiliate hash. The intent of this mechanism is to allow markets to opt into an Affiliate system with a central control and KYC process which they trust and expect users to register into.</p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="trading"></a>Trading<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#trading" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Trading encompasses the high level contract interactions which are used to match users of the protocol that wish to take complementary <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#share">share</a> positions in a <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#market">market</a>.</p><p>The trading contracts in the Augur contract repository are actually a collection of external contracts that are deployed alongside the core Augur protocol. This is significant in that if a problem is found in production that is isolated to the trading portion of contracts they can be redeployed safely without a new version of Augur.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="augur-trading"></a>Augur Trading<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#augur-trading" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The Augur Trading contract is the Trading equivalent of the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#augur">Augur</a> contract and performs essentially the same functions, but with the contracts which are related to trading instead. The Augur Trading contract does not however serve as a central authority for token transfers within the trading contracts, so individual approval is needed to use them.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="orders"></a>Orders<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#orders" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Orders represent a desire to take a position in a market and have the following qualities:</p><ul><li><strong>Type:</strong> One of BID or ASK, where BID means the order creator wishes to purchase the order’s outcome and ASK means they wish to sell the outcome.</li><li><strong>Outcome:</strong> The outcome the order type pertains to.

The core mechanism for disputing is to contribute to a different payout than the current tentative winning payout of a market. When an initial report is made it becomes the tentative winning payout. After that a new tentative winning payout can only occur by the process of disputing.</p><p>Contributing to an alternative payout is always done via the Market contract itself by specifying an amount of REP one is willing to stake toward it.

Each bond is associated with a payout that is being asserted as the correct resolution for the market.</p><p>Dispute crowdsourcing have a “size” which represents the amount of REP which must be staked for it to be successful and for the market’s tentative winning payout to become that of the bond.</p><p>This size is calculated with the following formula:</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_1XEh"><div class="codeBlockContent_1u-d"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_10dd">Copy</button><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_3iAC"><div class="codeBlockLines_b7E3" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">size = 2*stake_in_all_payouts - 3*stake_in_payout_being_asserted</span></div></div></div></div></div><p>This formula guarantees that the profit from correctly staking REP is 50% of what is staked by the winning contributors.

This means that once a bond is filled up to a particular amount the remaining amount must be filled entirely in any further contributions. This threshold is whatever the current <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#rep-bond">REP bond</a> for market creation is.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="fast--slow-disputing"></a>Fast &amp; Slow Disputing<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#fast--slow-disputing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Initially the contributions that are made to dispute the current tentative winning outcome may be made with no time restrictions. This means that as soon as a payout has been reported or has become the tentative winning payout through disputing someone may immediately dispute it. This is the phase of disputing known as “Fast” Disputing.</p><p>This phase is in place until a Dispute Bond is filled whose value implies there can be at most 8 more bonds until a <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#fork">fork</a> occurs. Once this threshold is reached contributions to disputes cannot be made until the Market’s current <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#dispute-window">Dispute Window</a> has started. This effectively means that there is at least a 7 day gap in between disputes and provides ample time for those who wish to participate in disputing and the potentially upcoming fork to get the REP out of cold storage. This phase is known as “Slow” disputing.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="pre-emptive-contributions"></a>Pre-emptive Contributions<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#pre-emptive-contributions" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Due to the nature of how a market <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#resolves">resolves</a> the system is vulnerable to a sort of greifing attack where an individual fills low value dispute bonds at the last possible second, dragging out the time it takes to complete.</p><p>In order to combat this there is an option when contributing to an initial report or a dispute contribution to also contribute excess REP in reserve for the case the asserted payout is disputed. This excess REP is only limited by the threshold where disputes enter <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#slow-disputing">Slow disputing</a> and will be used to dispute any new tentative winning payout immediately should one occur. This allows many rounds of back and forth disputing to essentially be skipped and presents an immediate threat to any trolling party that REP staked will likely be lost.</p><p>One important note about pre-emptive contributions is that any excess REP used this way is not guaranteed the normal 40% ROI on dispute contributions. This is because even if the pre-emptive bond is deployed it will likely be for much more REP than is actually available from losing bonds.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="forking"></a>Forking<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#forking" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>When a <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#dispute-bond">Dispute Bond</a>’s size reaches the <a href="/docs/contracts/overview#forking-threshold">forking threshold</a> it will trigger a Fork.

That fee is paid by the contract which the transaction is sent to.</p><p>The way in which we use GSN is a bit unconventional since the most often cited use case is for application developers to deposit ETH into a contract in order to pay for users transactions. Instead we have users pay for their own transactions with a wallet based system.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="augur-wallet"></a>Augur Wallet<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#augur-wallet" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The only contract which is used within the system currently is the Augur Wallet Registry. This contract also has only a single function available to call: “executeWalletTransaction”. This function takes the following parameters:</p><ul><li><strong>to:</strong> The contract which the user’s wallet is calling in the desired transaction</li><li><strong>data:</strong> The transaction data to use in the desired transaction call</li><li><strong>value:</strong> The ETH value to provide in the desired transaction from the wallet</li><li><strong>payment:</strong> The amount of DAI with this transaction is authorized to take from the wallet in order to compensate for the relay. Excess payment is refunded to the user’s account (not the wallet) as ETH.</li><li><strong>referralAddress:</strong> The affiliate address that referred the user. This is sent in the transaction execution data since a user’s wallet is created on demand as needed and this will be used to initialize their wallet.</li><li><strong>fingerprint:</strong> The browser fingerprint of the user. This is sent in the transaction execution data since a user’s wallet is created on demand as needed and this will be used to initialize their wallet.</li><li><strong>desiredSignerBalance:</strong> As a matter of practicality using GSN is very expensive. In order to limit the amount of times a user must actually use GSN the Augur Wallet Registry has the functionality to request the users signing account have ETH purchased for it using the wallet’s DAI. This parameter indicates the minimum amount of ETH desired to be in the user’s signing account. If their ETH balance is below this value a uniswap swap will be done at the end of the transaction in order to fulfil this desired ETH balance which can be used to directly execute transactions in the future.</li><li><strong>maxExchangeRateInDai:</strong> Whenever using Uniswap there must be restrictions provided from off chain on the exchange rate to prevent malicious front running attacks or to simply guard against sudden price movement.</li><li><strong>revertOnFailure:</strong> This boolean determines whether a transaction sent without the use of a GSN relayer will revert if the underlying requested transaction reverts. Normally we do not want transactions to fail, but in order to estimate gas it is necessary to have failing underlying calls make the entire transaction revert, so this is specified as true when estimating gas cost.</li></ul><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="warp-sync"></a>Warp Sync<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#warp-sync" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Usage of the Augur protocol with a reasonably nice UX is fairly dependent on the ability to access historical data with relative speed. Unfortunately the two prominent ways of providing such data for Ethereum applications, on chain storage or logs, are expensive and slow/unreliable respectively.</p><p>In order to make a faster and more robust method for pulling historical data there is a mechanism within Augur called “Warp Sync”. The core concept behind Augur’s Warp Sync is to package all Augur relevant logs into a single file whose hash can be trusted with no central authority and thus can be shared and distributed in a trustless and decentralized fashion. This way when a new user is initializing their state instead of having to pull potentially millions of logs they can instead download one compressed file.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_2cZh" id="warp-sync-contract"></a>Warp Sync Contract<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#warp-sync-contract" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The key component of the Warp Sync feature is the ability to trustlessly verify the hash of the Warp Sync file. In order to do this Augur has a built in feature where a recurring Warp Sync Hash prediction market can be created by any user in exchange for an increasing reward of minted REP. The formula for how much attoREP they will receive is as follows:</p><div class="mdxCodeBlock_1XEh"><div class="codeBlockContent_1u-d"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" class="copyButton_10dd">Copy</button><div tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_3iAC"><div class="codeBlockLines_b7E3" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><div class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">(time_since_create ** 3) * 1000</span></div></div></div></div></div><p>This provides an exponential growth amount that will also not get out of control in a time span that is manipulatable via block stuffing.</p><p>These markets exist on a per universe basis and are not intended to be traded on. They merely exist as a way to leverage the Augur oracle for determining the correct Warp Sync hash.</p></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur/edit/documentation/augur.sh/../docs/contracts/overview.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 40 40" style="margin-right:0.3em;vertical-align:sub"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_3klQ"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#augur" class="table-of-contents__link">Augur</a></li><li><a href="#deployment" class="table-of-contents__link">Deployment</a></li><li><a href="#contract-legitimacy" class="table-of-contents__link">Contract Legitimacy</a></li><li><a href="#contract-events" class="table-of-contents__link">Contract Events</a></li><li><a href="#authorized-token-transfers" class="table-of-contents__link">Authorized Token Transfers</a></li><li><a href="#upgrade-day" class="table-of-contents__link">Upgrade Day</a></li><li><a href="#universes" class="table-of-contents__link">Universes</a><ul><li><a href="#markets" class="table-of-contents__link">Markets</a></li><li><a href="#universe-forking" class="table-of-contents__link">Universe Forking</a></li><li><a href="#reporting-fee" class="table-of-contents__link">Reporting Fee</a></li><li><a href="#reputation-token" class="table-of-contents__link">Reputation Token</a></li><li><a href="#legacy-reputation-token" class="table-of-contents__link">Legacy Reputation Token</a></li><li><a href="#rep-price-oracle" class="table-of-contents__link">Rep Price Oracle</a></li><li><a href="#oi" class="table-of-contents__link">OI</a></li><li><a href="#parasitic-oi" class="table-of-contents__link">Parasitic OI</a></li><li><a href="#oi-cash" class="table-of-contents__link">OI Cash</a></li><li><a href="#dsr" class="table-of-contents__link">DSR</a></li><li><a href="#bond-values" class="table-of-contents__link">Bond Values</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#markets-1" class="table-of-contents__link">Markets</a><ul><li><a href="#creation-parameters" class="table-of-contents__link">Creation Parameters</a></li><li><a href="#market-types" class="table-of-contents__link">Market Types</a></li><li><a href="#rep-bond" class="table-of-contents__link">REP Bond</a></li><li><a href="#validity-bond" class="table-of-contents__link">Validity Bond</a></li><li><a href="#shares" class="table-of-contents__link">Shares</a></li><li><a href="#resolution" class="table-of-contents__link">Resolution</a></li><li><a href="#affiliates" class="table-of-contents__link">Affiliates</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#trading" class="table-of-contents__link">Trading</a><ul><li><a href="#augur-trading" class="table-of-contents__link">Augur Trading</a></li><li><a href="#orders" class="table-of-contents__link">Orders</a></li><li><a href="#on-chain-trading" class="table-of-contents__link">On Chain Trading</a></li><li><a href="#0x-token-trading" class="table-of-contents__link">0x Token Trading</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#reporting" class="table-of-contents__link">Reporting</a><ul><li><a href="#payouts" class="table-of-contents__link">Payouts</a></li><li><a href="#initial-report" class="table-of-contents__link">Initial Report</a></li><li><a href="#disputing" class="table-of-contents__link">Disputing</a></li><li><a href="#resolution--finalization" class="table-of-contents__link">Resolution / Finalization</a></li><li><a href="#dispute-windows" class="table-of-contents__link">Dispute Windows</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#gsn" class="table-of-contents__link">GSN</a><ul><li><a href="#augur-wallet" class="table-of-contents__link">Augur Wallet</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#warp-sync" class="table-of-contents__link">Warp Sync</a><ul><li><a href="#warp-sync-contract" class="table-of-contents__link">Warp Sync Contract</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="text--center"><div>Copyright © 2020 Forecast Foundation OU.
