Call API
========
```javascript
// Call API Example
/**
* Get the Number of Outcomes for the Market at address:
* 0x9368ff3e9ce1c0459b309fac6dd4e69229b91a42
*/

var market = "0x9368ff3e9ce1c0459b309fac6dd4e69229b91a42";

// augur.api.<Contract Name>.<Contract Method>(<Params Object>, <Callback Function>);

augur.api.Market.getNumberOfOutcomes({ 
  tx: { to: market } 
}, function (error, numberOfOutcomes) {
  console.log(error);
  console.log(numberOfOutcomes);
});
// console prints 2
```
The Call API of augur.js is made up of "getter" functions that retrieve information from Augur's Solidity smart contracts using Ethereum's `eth_call` RPC; however, these functions do not write any information to the Ethereum blockchain. The Call API is intended for more granular "gets" than the [Simplified API](#simplified-api) allows, and its functions are mapped directly to the public functions of Augur's Solidity smart contracts. 

All functions in the Call API accept two arguments: 

1. `p`, a parameters object containing any key/value pairs matching the input parameters for the contract method, and (in some cases) a `tx` object with the Ethereum contract address to call. The `tx` object is described in more detail in the [Transaction API](#transaction-api) section. 
2. A callback function. 

The Call API functions are part of the `augur.api` object and follow a pattern of `augur.api.<Contract Name>.<Contract Function>(<Parameters Object>, <Callback Function>)`.

<aside class="notice">Augur's Call API has been updated to return promises. Passing in a callback still works the same as before; however, now the underlying promise is returned directly to the caller.</aside>

Provides JavaScript bindings for the [ReputationToken Solidity Contract](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core/blob/master/source/contracts/reporting/ReputationToken.sol), which handles the approval, migration, and transfering of [Reputation Tokens](#rep). 

The Reputation Token, or REP, is an ERC-20 token that implements all of the required functions listed in the [ERC-20 Token Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20). It does not, however, implement the optional functions.

    * **`p._spender`** (string) Ethereum address of the contract allowed to spend on behalf of `p._owner`, as a 20-byte hexadecimal string. (This should be the address of the Augur.sol contract.)
    * **`p.tx`** (Object) Object containing details about how this function call should be made.
        * **`p.tx.to`** (string) Ethereum contract address of the ReputationToken contract on which to call this function, as a 20-byte hexadecimal string.

Returns the total [Theoretical REP Supply](#theoretical-rep-supply) for this ReputationToken contract. Note: To ensure this number is as accurate as possible, `augur.api.ReputationToken.updateParentTotalTheoreticalSupply` should first be called on the ReputationToken contract, and `augur.api.ReputationToken.updateSiblingMigrationTotal` should be called on any ReputationToken contracts that have the same [Parent Universe](#parent-universe).

#### **Parameters:**
