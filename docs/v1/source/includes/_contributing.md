============

We think Augur and Ethereum are pretty awesome, and believe that they're going to change the world.  We'd love it if you want to be a part of this -- as a user, tester, or developer!

Before you submit a pull request to the Augur Project, you should make sure you have linted your code so that it fits the Augur Project standards and you have updated/added unit tests for your changes. You can find more details about testing and linting in the [tests](#tests) section of these documents.

Most of our day-to-day conversation happens on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). (We also have an IRC gateway in #augur on Freenode that is connected to our Discord chat!) Our Discord conversations are open. If you'd like to join the conversation, just go to [invite.augur.net](https://invite.augur.net) and sign up. We love to hear feedback from people who are as excited as we are about Augur!
