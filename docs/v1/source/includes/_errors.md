Errors
======
```json
{
    "error": 412,
    "message": "transaction validation failed"
}
```

In addition to the error codes generated by the Augur API, there is a separate set of error codes used by Augur's [smart contracts](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core).  To avoid confusion, API error codes are positive integers, while contract error codes are integers less than or equal to zero.

API and contract errors are returned as objects that contain an `error` field (the integer error code) and a `message` field (a description of the error).

<aside class="notice">In addition to the errors tabulated below, contract methods may also return <code>"0x"</code>, accompanied by the message <code>"no response or bad input"</code>.  This error indicates that either the contract was unreachable or the invoked method did not execute successfully.</aside>
